# Grayscale to Colored Image Converter 🎨

This project converts **grayscale images into realistic color images** using a **deep learning–based image colorization model**.  
It uses a **pretrained CNN (Caffe model)** integrated via **OpenCV’s DNN module**.

The model predicts the **`ab` color channels** in the LAB color space from a single **L (lightness) channel**, effectively hallucinating plausible colors.

## 📌 How It Works (Conceptual Overview)

1. The input image is converted from **BGR → LAB color space**
2. The **L channel (lightness)** is extracted
3. A pretrained CNN predicts the **`ab` chrominance channels**
4. The predicted `ab` channels are merged with the original `L`
5. The image is converted back to **BGR**, producing a colorized result

This approach is based on research by **Zhang et al. (2016)** on automatic image colorization.
